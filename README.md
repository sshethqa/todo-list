# Todo List

Super simple todo app built in Python.

The instructions in this README file assume you are running the application on an Ubuntu or Debian machine.

## Task

Please fork the repository to create a copy of the code under your own account.

Your task is as follows:

* Follow through with this video to learn how to the Todo List app works and how to get it running with Jenkins
	
* Use credentials to set the environment variables (the export commands)
	
* Get the Jenkins job to run the tests, as described in the README
	
* Read through the README and figure out how you could get the app to run as a background process
	
* NEW: use the Jenkins plugins JUnit and Cobertura to publish the test reports (video here)
	
* NEW: set up a webhook between your forked GitHub repo and Jenkins so that new pushes will trigger the job to start

## Prerequisites

Clone down the repo and `cd` into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/htr-volker/todo-list
cd todo-list
```

Install Python3, pip and venv:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y
```

Install the pip requirements:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You need to set the database URI that the app needs to connect to and a secret key. This is done via *environment variables*.

```bash
export DATABASE_URI=[YOUR_DB_URI]
export SECRET_KEY=[YOUR_SECRET_KEY]
```

The secret key can be any value. If you don't have a separate database you can use, you can set the Database URI to an in-memory database using SQLite. You can use these variables to get the app started:

```bash
export DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///data.db
export SECRET_KEY="ssshh it's a secret!"
```

This will just store your database data in a file called `data.db`.

You will then need to run the `create.py` python script to generate the database schema.

```bash
python3 create.py
```

## Running the App

Simply enter the following in your bash terminal:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

The    website will be accessible on port 5000 on your machine's IP.

Make sure the machine's firewall rules allow network traffic on port 5000.

To stop the application, enter `ctrl+C`.

## Testing the Application

Make sure the current working directory is this repository.

Install `pytest`:

```bash
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
pip3 install pytest pytest-cov
```

Run `pytest` and generate test and coverage reports:

```bash
python3 -m pytest --doctest-modules --junitxml=junit/test-results.xml --cov=application --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html
```

This will generate reports that are readable by JUnit and Cobertura.

For your Jenkins jobs:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
export DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///data.db
export SECRET_KEY="ssshh it's a secret!"
pip3 install pytest pytest-cov flask_testing
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pytest --cov=application --junitxml=junit/test-results.xml --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html
```

## Running as a Systemd Service (Background Service)

The `deploy.sh` script contains the commands required to run the application as a `systemd` service (a daemon) which will run in the background. It will generate a `systemd` service script with the required environment variables.

You will still need to set your `DATABASE_URI` and `SECRET_KEY` environment variables as described above before running the script

The command to run the script is:
```bash
bash jenkins/deploy.sh
```
